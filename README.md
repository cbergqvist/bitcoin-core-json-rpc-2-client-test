Minimal test for running a JSON-RPC 2.0 client against bitcoin-core with PR [#27101](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27101) applied.

Uses [jsonrpsee](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee) which is very popular according to crates.io and actually built by Parity Technologies. That means if this works, Bitcoin Core is one step closer to being as dev-friendly as certain other projects.
